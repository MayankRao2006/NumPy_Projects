📊 Student Marks Analyzer (NumPy Project)
This is a beginner-friendly Python project that analyzes students' subject-wise marks using the NumPy library. It calculates averages, converts data into 2D NumPy arrays, and displays structured information for clarity.

🚀 What This Project Does
Stores subject-wise marks for multiple students using Python dictionaries.

Converts marks to NumPy arrays.

Calculates average marks per student and per subject.

Displays structured mark sheets.

Demonstrates use of custom functions and NumPy’s mean and array operations.

🧠 Key Concepts Used
numpy.array(): for converting lists into arrays.

numpy.mean(): for computing averages across axes.

Dictionary manipulation

Looping through data dynamically

Custom function creation

💡 Sample Output

Jhon's Marks are:
Maths:92
Science:90
Geography:82
English:80
The average is: 86.0

The Values converted to an 2D array looks like:

[[ 92  90  82  80]
 [100  92  85  81]
 [ 89  82  99  72]
 [ 90  81  85  93]]

The mean of all the students in each subject is:

Maths: 92.75
Science: 86.25
Geography: 87.75
English: 81.5
